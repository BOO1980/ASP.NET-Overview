        <p>The following table describes the components of the .Net framework 3.5 and the job they perform</p>
        <dl><dt></dt><dd>It performs memory management, exception, handling, debugging, security checking, thread execution, code execution, code safety, verification, and compilation.  The code that is directly managed by the CLR is called the managed code  When the managed code is compiled, the compiler converts the source code into a CPU independent intermediate language (IL) code, A Just in time (JIT) compiler compiles the IL code into native code, which is CPU specific</dd>
            <dt>.Net Framework Class Library</dt><dd>It contains a huge library of reusable types. classes, interfaces, structures, and enumerated values, which are collectively called types</dd>
            <dt>Common Language Specification</dt><dd>It contains the specifications for the .Net supported languages and implementation of language integration</dd>
            <dt>Common Type System</dt><dd>It provides guidelines for declaring, using, and managing types at runtime, and cross-language communication.</dd>
            <dt>Metadata and Assemblies</dt><dd>Metadata is the binary information describing the program, which is either stored in a portable executable file (PE) or in the memory. Assembly is a logical unit consisting of the assembly manifest, type metadata, IL code, and a set of resources like image files.</dd>
            <dt>Windows Forms</dt><dd>Windows Forms contain the graphical representation of any window displayed in the application.</dd>
         
            <dt>ASP.NET and ASP.NET AJAX</dt><dd>ASP.NET is the web development model and AJAX is an extension of ASP.NET for developing and implementing AJAX functionality. ASP.NET AJAX contains the components that allow the developer to update data on a website without a complete reload of the page.</dd>
            <dt>ADO.NET</dt><dd>It is the technology used for working with data and databases. It provides access to data sources like SQL server, OLE DB, XML etc. The ADO.NET allows connection to data sources for retrieving, manipulating, and updating data.</dd>

            <dt>Windows Presentation Foundation</dt><dd>It provides a separation between the user interface and the business logic. It helps in developing visually stunning interfaces using documents, media, two and three dimensional graphics, animations, and more.</dd>
            <dt>Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)</dt><dd>It is the technology used for building and executing connected systems.</dd>
            <dt>Windows CardSpace</dt><dd>It provides safety for accessing resources and sharing personal information on the internet.</dd>
            <dt>LINQ</dt><dd>It provides safety for accessing resources and sharing personal information on the internet.</dd>
