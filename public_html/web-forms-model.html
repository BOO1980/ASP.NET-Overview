               <h2>ASP.NET Web Forms Model</h2>
        <ul><li>ASP.NET web forms extend the event-driven model of interaction to the web applications</li>
            <li>The browser submits a web form to the web server and the server returns a full markup page or HTML page in response</li>
            <li>All client side user activities are forwarded to the server for stateful processing, then the server processes the output of the client actions and triggers the reactions </li>
            <li>ASP.NET framework helps in storing the information regarding the state of the application which consists of<dl><dt>Page State</dt><dd>The page state is the page of the client, i.e. the various input fields in the web form</dd>
                    <dt>Session state</dt><dd>The session state is the collective information obtained from various pages the user visited and worked with i.e. The overall session state</dd></dl></li>
            <li>The ASP.NET runtime carries the page state to and from the server across page requests while generating ASP.NET runtime codes and incorporate the state of the serve side components in hidden fields</li>
            <li>The serve becomes aware of the overall application state and operates in a two-tiered connected way</li>
        </ul>
