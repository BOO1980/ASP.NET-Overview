        <h1>ASP.NET Overview</h1>
        <ul><li>ASP.NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites</li>
            <li>ASP.NET allows you to use a full featured programming language such as C# or VB.Net to build web application easily</li>
            <li>ASP.NET provides a programming model which is a comprehensive software infrastructure and various services required to build up robust web applications for the PC as well as mobile devices</li>
            <li>ASP.NET works on top of the HTTP protocol and uses the HTTP commands and polices to set a browser to server bilateral communication and cop-operation</li>
            <li>ASP.NET is part of Microsoft .Net platform</li>
            <li>ASP.NET applications are compiled codes written using the extensible and reusable components or objects present in .Net framework</li>
            <li>ASP.NET application codes can be written in any of the following languages <ul><li>
                        C#
                    </li>
                    <li>Visual Basic .Net</li>
                    <li>Jscript</li>
                    <li>J#</li></ul>

            </li>
            <li>ASP.NET is used to produce interactive, data-driven web applications over the Internet</li>
            <li>ASP.NET consist of a large number of controls such as text boxes, buttons and labels fro assembling, configuring, and manipulating code to create HTML pages</li>
                <li>Although a web site is simple, the process that eventually results in the page Default.aspx being displayed in your browser isn't so simple.  ASP.BET page can't do much.  It needs to be processed and served by a web server before the browser can display it.  Thats why VS automatically started up by IIS Express to handle the request for the page</li>
        <li>It is important to realize that the ASPX file you modified in VS is not the same as the one that eventually gets displayed by the browser</li> 
        <li>When you create a page in VS you add markup to it.  The markup is an aspx page that is a combination of HTML code for ASP.NET Server controls, code written in Visual Basic.NET or C# and more</li>
        <li>When you request as ASPX page in your browser the web server process the page, executes any server-side code it finds in the file, and effectiveness transforms the ASP.NET markup into plain HTML that it then sends to the browser, where it is displayed</li>
        <li>When running the original ASPX an page you will see when looking under the source of the developer mode that it differs from the original code </li>
        
        
        </ul>

        <h2>Shopping cart example</h2>
        <ul><li>Users add items to a shopping cart</li>
            <li>Items are selected from a page</li>
            <li>The cart page contain the total items and prices</li>
            <li>HTTP cannot keep track of all the information coming from various pages</li>
            <li>ASP.NET session state and server side infrastructure keeps track of the information collected globally over a session</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul><li>When you type a URL like www.wrox.com in your web browser and press Enter, the browser sends a request to the web server at that address</li>
            <li>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol by which web browsers and web servers communicate</li>
            <li>When you request the URL you send a request to the server</li>
            <li>When the server is active and the request is valid, the server accepts the request, processes it, and then sends the response back to the client browser</li>
            <li>Because you are using the IIS Express, the server and the client are really the same machine</li>
            <li>In a real world scenario, the website is hosted on an external web server where it can be accessed by many different clients</li>
            <li>For static files like HTML files or images, the web server simply reads the file from its local hard drive and sends in to the browser</li>
            <li>If the web server hands over the request to another piece of software that ables to process the page - the concept is called Application Mapping or Handler Mapping, where the extention to a file is mapped to an application that is capable of handling it</li></ul>
